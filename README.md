# Churn-Prediction-Model
Introduction

Welcome to the Churn Prediction Model project! This project aims to build a classification model that accurately predicts customer churn based on various features and data points. The model is designed to help businesses proactively address churn and enhance customer retention.

Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical issue for telecommunication companies, impacting revenue and profitability. In a competitive market, retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project leverages data on customer demographics, usage patterns, and interactions with customer service to predict churn and enable targeted retention strategies.

Data Cleaning

The dataset used for this project contained a mix of objects, strings, and integers. We converted categorical variables into dummy variables and handled null values appropriately. Highly correlated features were removed to prevent multicollinearity and improve model performance.

Model Selection

We chose a random forest classifier for this project due to its robustness and effectiveness in classification tasks. The model was tuned using hyperparameters to achieve high AUC and F1 scores.

Results

The model achieved an AUC of 0.93 on the training data and 0.918 on the test data, indicating strong predictive accuracy. Key features influencing churn were identified, enabling targeted retention strategies.

Recommendations

Based on the model's insights, we recommend focusing on cost optimization, improving customer service, and offering flexible usage plans to reduce churn and enhance customer satisfaction.

Conclusion

Our churn prediction model demonstrates significant potential in identifying at-risk customers and enabling proactive retention strategies. By leveraging key features and optimizing model performance, businesses can allocate resources efficiently, improve customer satisfaction, and reduce churn rates.
